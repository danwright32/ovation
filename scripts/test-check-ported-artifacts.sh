# The ported artifact check must report a port made from a commit that is not on
# its sibling's main, must say CANNOT MEASURE when the sibling repository is not
# on this machine, and must never report either of those as a pass.
#
# Ovation ports at least eleven files one line at a time from Downbeat and
# Overture (implementation plan 0.4.6). A clone copies the pattern AS FIRST
# WRITTEN, including every value already corrected in the original, and the
# clone's own note that it follows a proven pattern is what makes it read as safe
# (L501). This plan already caught one instance of exactly that in itself: an
# earlier draft ported Downbeat's identity guard as it stood before L217
# corrected it.
#
# Every outcome the check's contract enumerates is PRODUCED here, not merely
# described (L151), and each assertion names the specific outcome rather than
# accepting any failure (L140).
#
# The two that matter most and are easiest to get wrong:
#
#   CANNOT MEASURE must never be a pass. A checker that reports green because it
#   could not find the repository it was meant to check is indistinguishable from
#   one that checked everything (L98), and the green is then read as confirmation.
#
#   FINDING NOTHING must be its own outcome. Ovation has zero ported files today,
#   so a check that exits 0 on an empty tree would report success for months and
#   be trusted by the time it matters (L98, L182).
