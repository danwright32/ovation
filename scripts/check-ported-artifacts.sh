# Assert that every file Ovation ported from a sibling repository records where
# it came from, and that the commit it names is still on that sibling's main.
#
# Implementation plan 0.4.6. Ovation ports at least eleven files one line at a
# time from Downbeat and Overture. A clone copies the pattern AS FIRST WRITTEN,
# including every value already corrected in the original, and the clone's own
# note that it follows a proven pattern is what makes it read as safe (L501). A
# port made from a stale checkout or an unmerged branch is therefore reported
# here rather than assumed.
#
# Every ported file carries, at the START of a comment line, in its own comment
# syntax ('#' for shell, yaml and gitignore, '//' for Swift):
#
#      <comment opener><space>Ported<dash>From: <owner>/<repo> <path> @ <commit>
#
# The marker is written with <dash> there on purpose. THIS SCRIPT HAS TO NAME ITS
# OWN NEEDLE IN ORDER TO SEARCH FOR IT, so an unescaped example here would make
# the check match itself, its own test, and every document describing the
# convention (L245). Measured on the first real run: seven bogus artifacts, all
# of them this file and its test.
#
# The remedy is the RULE, not a list of exempt filenames (L362). A real header
# sits at the start of its comment; prose about one is indented inside a block.
# So the match is anchored to allow at most one space after the comment opener,
# which no explanatory paragraph satisfies.
#
# Outcomes, one per artifact, each with its own wording because distinct causes
# need distinct messages (L11):
#
#     OK                  the commit is an ancestor of that sibling's main
#     NOT ON MAIN         the sibling was found, the commit is not on its main
#     COMMIT NOT FOUND    the sibling was found, the commit is not in it at all
#     CANNOT MEASURE      the sibling repository is not on this machine
#     UNREADABLE HEADER   a Ported-From line that cannot be parsed
#
# Exit codes, so a caller can tell them apart without parsing text:
#
#     0  every artifact verified, and there was at least one
#     1  at least one NOT ON MAIN
#     2  at least one CANNOT MEASURE or COMMIT NOT FOUND
#     3  no ported artifacts found at all
#     4  at least one UNREADABLE HEADER
#
# NOTHING FOUND IS NOT A PASS. Ovation has zero ported files on the day this is
# written, and a check that exits 0 on an empty tree would report success for
# months and be believed by the time it mattered (L98, L182). CANNOT MEASURE is
# not a pass either, for the same reason: a checker that goes green because it
# could not find what it was meant to check is indistinguishable from one that
# checked everything.
#
# Seams, so the test suite never reads a real sibling repository (L2):
#     OVATION_PORT_SCAN_ROOT         where to look for ported files
#     OVATION_SIBLING_SEARCH_ROOTS   colon separated roots to resolve siblings in

# EVERY QUESTION TO A SIBLING GOES THROUGH `clean_git` FROM THE LIBRARY. An
# inherited GIT_DIR beats `git -C`, and git exports GIT_DIR to its hooks. From the
# primary checkout that survived by luck, because a relative `.git` beside
# `-C /path/to/sibling` resolves to the sibling's own; from a worktree it is
# absolute, every sibling answered with Ovation's own origin, and a push was
# refused for nine unmeasurable ports on 2026-09-08 with all nine present (L70,
# L621).

# Which checkout a sibling is comes from the library's resolve_sibling (ovation#417).

# THE REFS THAT MEAN MAIN, every one the sibling has, REMOTE TRACKING FIRST
# (ovation#401). A checkout another session works in stands on a feature branch,
# and its local main is not moved by pulls to that branch, so it lags. A port taken
# from the real main was refused as "a branch that never merged", the opposite of
# what happened. A local copy is named after what it mirrors (L454), so the remote
# tracking main is asked first and the local one second, and whichever answers is
# named. Nothing here fetches or moves either: that checkout is another session's.
# Refused rather than guessed if the sibling has neither.
