# Asking git about a repository, and finding the folder the sibling checkouts
# live in. ovation#314.
#
# Sourced, never run. `scripts/test-sibling-root.sh` covers both functions and
# holds the scan that refuses a hand rolled copy of either anywhere else.
#
# WHY ONE FILE. Three scripts each carried their own copy of `clean_git` under
# three names, and three found Downbeat and Overture three different ways: the
# parent of the running checkout, and two folder names typed under the home
# directory. The first was wrong in every worktree, which is where nearly every
# push is made from, so the plan claims check had been answering CANNOT MEASURE
# on those pushes and the gate let it through (L668, L98). The typed names were
# right only until something moved, and Overture's move had already blinded one
# of them once (L153). A shared definition is the component; the scan is the
# guard; neither is worth much without the other (L613).

# ASKING A REPOSITORY ABOUT ITSELF NEEDS MORE THAN `git -C`. An inherited GIT_DIR
# BEATS the -C, so every question would be answered by whatever GIT_DIR names.
# Git EXPORTS GIT_DIR to its hooks and the whole suite runs inside the pre-push
# hook, so this is the ordinary case rather than a hypothetical: on 2026-09-08 it
# made a push report nine siblings as absent while all nine sat on the disk, and
# made the install record describe the pushing worktree instead of the fixture it
# was handed.

# The folder holding the PRIMARY checkout of the repository <dir> belongs to,
# which is where Downbeat and Overture sit beside Ovation.
#
#     sibling_root <dir>      prints the folder, or refuses with a reason on stderr
#
# IT IS ASKED OF GIT, NOT OF THE PATH. A worktree's own top level is somewhere
# inside the primary checkout, so any answer built from where the running copy
# sits is wrong from a worktree. Git's COMMON directory is the primary checkout's
# `.git` from every worktree of it, so the folder above that checkout is the same
# answer from all of them.
#
# IT REFUSES RATHER THAN GUESSES. A copy of Ovation that is not a git checkout,
# or one whose git folder is not inside a checkout, has no primary checkout to
# stand beside, and a guessed folder would send every caller to look somewhere
# arbitrary and report the siblings missing (L75, L11).
