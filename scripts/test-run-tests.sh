# The test runner must genuinely exclude BOTH siblings, release both locks on
# every exit path including a crash, and refuse rather than fail obscurely when
# the tool one of them needs is absent.
#
# ovation#12, decided by Dan on 2026-09-05 as option A: Ovation takes both
# existing locks, by the mechanism each one uses, in a fixed order. Nothing in
# Downbeat or Overture changes.
#
# The two locks use DIFFERENT mechanisms and cannot be merged: Downbeat takes a
# DIRECTORY with mkdir, Overture takes a FILE with Homebrew flock. flock opens
# with O_CREAT and cannot open an existing directory that way; mkdir on a path
# holding a regular file returns EEXIST. So this takes each by its own means.
#
# Every case runs against THROWAWAY lock paths. Nothing here touches
# /tmp/xcodebuild-tests.lock or /tmp/overture-mac-tests.lock, because a test that
# took the real locks would block Dan's other two apps (L2).

#    and they use no xcodebuild and share nothing with either sibling. A gate
#    that queues its cheap checks behind another app's build is a gate people
#    learn to skip (L378, L299).

#     chose and which neither sibling can see or diagnose.
#
#     So the second lock is tried WITHOUT blocking, and if it is not free the
#     first is RELEASED before waiting and retrying. Ovation waits for both,
#     holds neither while waiting, and still cannot deadlock.
